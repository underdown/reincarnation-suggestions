# this is a list of suggestions for TR Beta server

* allow lucky cauldron to produce MI - I polled a bunch of users - none recalled ever getting an MI
* remove the turn taken when selling items.  If someone zeros your geld currently - you geld crash when you sell items.  Makes it difficult.
* remove one hero type cap.  I realize this would likely be a big undertaking so not optimiztic this is feasible.  With lucky cauldron being so different in nature - alowing more than one hero would make it interesting.
