# this is a list of suggestions for TR Beta server

* allow lucky cauldron to produce MI - I polled a bunch of users - none recalled ever getting an MI
* remove the turn taken when selling items.  If someone zeros your geld currently - you geld crash when you sell items.  Makes it difficult.
* remove one hero type cap.  I realize this would likely be a big undertaking so not optimiztic this is feasible.  With lucky cauldron being so different in nature - alowing more than one hero would make it interesting.
* [TEJAS] new spell "Mexican invasion" offensive when cast 1 mill NP worth of starving peasants invade your kingdom, farms produce 20% better, White ultimate replacing miracle 250 mana to cast 5 turns, max 5 times per day.
* Nerf VE slightly.  With this number of turns its pretty trivial to keep someone in VE prot

* lucky Cauldron changes:

My goal here is to reduce the # of items in each pack in order to make the use of Premiums a more strategic choice again, and to make the packs a little more interesting and useful so that every level has a potential to give you a chase item. The numbers below are obviously more complicated, but they need to be in order to make it harder to abuse packs since I added chase items to all of them. With these changes I think we can make Lucky Cauldron a little more interesting than "Buy Ultra Packs":

* Lesser pack: 10 mil gold
  * 6 random lesser items (93%)
  * Random level 8-13 hero (4.25%)
  * Random level 14-17 hero (1.1%)

  * Random ancient spell (0.05%)
  * Random unique (0.10%)
